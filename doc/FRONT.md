# Front

## Explore

- on initial display, the *explore* view shows the content of the configured `root-dir-path`
- when the user clicks on a folder, the view shows the content of this folder
 
## persistence 

- when the user navigates from the *explorer* to another page (e.g "About") and then goes back to the *explore* view via the main menu, the view *explorer* view is restored : it displays the content of the same thing that before navigating away.
